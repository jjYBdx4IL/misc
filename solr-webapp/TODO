* introduce concept of printable characters in the search term transformer to support
  searching for words with non-ASCII characters lik öäüß
* pause on low disk?

* 75% of crawler time is currently spent on tasks of which some could be reduced to almost 0 time:
** waiting for remote servers (> 50%) -> parallel async requests
** parsing using tika server: need to check if jsoup parsing is considerably faster
** adding new URLs to the database (quite massive db index maintenance overhead!) -> switch to cloud tech,
   ie some sort of merge sort and stream-processing of json-encoded structured data. (json serialization is
   much faster than Java object serialization)

* some AI/algorithm is needed to calculate a processing priority that is not only based on scheduledUpdate, ie.
prioritizes manually added URLs etc.

* (maybe) support HTTP redirects. currently disabled because we need to intercept them to validate them 
and to remove/block/change the original url.
