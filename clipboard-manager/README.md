## Features

* Auto-decrypt PGP messages. Does not support user interactions, ie. either have your keys already unlocked or

* Maven dependency conversion: converts short-hand forms (ie. `group:artifact:jar`) of maven dependency
specifications to a form that's usable in pom.xml maven project descriptor files.
