# ECS

A HTML/XML generator.

Repackaging of the officially retired Apache Jakarta ECS project at https://jakarta.apache.org/ecs/.

This version is simply a redeployment to maven central with the following changes:

* Added compatibility with Java 8.
* Upgraded dependencies.
* Added javadoc jar,
* added source jar.
* enabled debug symbols for more user convenience.

Also added a first, simple test unit. If you got some examples/test units, feel
free to submit them under the Apache v1.1 license.

Obviously, this repository is not related to Apache in any way.
